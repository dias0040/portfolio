# portfolio
As a 3D artist, I wanted my portfolio to be clean, easy to navigate, and visually engaging. I focused on showcasing my best work while keeping the layout simple and professional.

One of the biggest challenges was optimizing large 3D renders for fast loading. I resolved this by compressing images and using short video loops for turntables. I also had to balance creativity with usability—making sure visitors could quickly understand my skills and find key projects.

Through this process, I learned how important user experience and consistency are in presenting creative work. My portfolio isn’t just a gallery—it's a reflection of my design thinking and growth as an artist.
